 <p class="temp-p">Cloud computing delivers faster recovery times and multi-site availably at a friction of the cost of conventional disaster recovery.<br><br>


Cloud Computing , based on virtualization, take a very differs approach to disaster recovery. With virtualization, the entire server, including the operation system, application, patches and data is in encapsulated into a single software bundle or virtual server. The entire virtual server can be coped or backed up to an or site data center and spoon up on a virtual host in a matter of minutes.<br><br>

Finally this cloud shifts the disaster recovery trade of crew to the left, as soon below. With cloud computation, disaster recovery become more cost effective with significantly faster recovery rate.</p>
